   About

     Pymedia is a cross-platfrom library designed to make it easy to
     write multimedia software, such as audio, video players. 
     Small size makes it perfect for embedded mutlimedia software 
     development. 
     It requires the Python language.

   Installation

     The installation is pretty simple is you have Python 2.2+ installed.
     Just type: "python setup.py build" as normal user and 
     "python setup.py install" as superuser. You may wish to run latter without
     the first one. As superuser of course.
     If you wish to be able to play movies, you'll need SDL to be installed
     and compile pymedia with "python setup.py build SDL" instead.
     In case if experience compilation problems such as this:
     	"can't find a register in class `GENERAL_REGS' while reloading `asm':
     Try to edit file /usr/local/lib/python?.?/config/Makefile and remove the following:
     	GCCSHARED = -fPIC

   Help

     If you want to get started with some hands on experience, just go to the 
     examples directory. You'll find some usefull but simple examples of how you 
     can use mutlimedia features directly from Python. 
     Then if you need additional information and features description, open the
     docs/index.html.

     Visit pymedia website, there is documentation section as well. 
     You should know that the online documentation stays
     up to date with the development version of pymedia in cvs. This may
     be a bit newer than the version of pymedia you are using.

   Credits

     Thanks to everyone who has helped contribute to this library.
     Special thanks are also in order.

     Elena K - for creating such a great web site for pymedia

   Dependencies

     Pymedia has no external dependencies if you use basic funtionality.
     Hovewer if you want to get more codecs, you should install appropriate 
     libraries. Here is the list:
     - libvorbis
     - libogg
     - libfaad2
     In case if you wish to play movies, there is SDL library needed.
     ( http://libsdl.org )

   Todo / Ideas
     * Better codecs support
     * Support for dvd hw decoding
     * Support for encoding interfaces
     * Support for usb devices

     This basically means you can use pygame in any project you want,
     but if you make any changes or additions to pygame itself, those
     must be released with a compatible license. (preferably submitted
     back to the pygame project). Closed source and commercial apps are
     fine.

     The programs in the "examples" directory are in the public domain.  
  
  Best wishes !
